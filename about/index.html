  <h1 class="backdrop about">About me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Enrico Campidoglio. I’m a programmer with a strong passion for
    quality and good old fashioned knowlege sharing. Some people say I may also
    have a mild OCD. I currently work as a consultant at <a href="http://tretton37.com">tretton37</a> in Lund, Sweden.
  </p>
  <p>
    I consider myself lucky because my craft is also my passion. I love to
    continuously try to get better at what I do, by learning from the experience
    of others as well as my own. I also enjoy reading books, magazines and blogs
    either about some specific piece of technology I’m currently interested in, or
    about software development in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another thing I find extremely rewarding, is to exchange knowledge with the
    community. I like to actively take part in the conversation by <a
        href="http://twitter.com/ecampidoglio">tweeting</a>, <a
        href="http://megakemp.com">blogging</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/26396">answering questions</a> and
    <a href="http://megakemp.com/speaking">speaking</a> at conferences and user groups about the subjects that I’m most
    passionate about. I’ll talk to anyone who will listen about object-oriented
    design, unit testing, architecture and, occasionally, <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Main_Page">mechanical keyboards</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  On my spare time I contribute to <a href="http://github.com/AutoFixture">AutoFixture</a>, an open source library for .NET
    that helps alleviate some of the friction experienced when doing Test-driven
    development by making it easier to generate test data.
  </p>
  <p>
    When not in front of a computer, I spend time with my family or go out for a
    long run.
