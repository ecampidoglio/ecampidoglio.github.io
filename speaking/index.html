  <p>
    Going out and meet the developer community while giving technical talks is something I
    truly enjoy. Whether it be at a big conference, a user group or at a
    client, I love sharing knowledge and experiences. And the best part is, it
    goes both ways: with every presentation, I teach something and learn something new myself.

    I try to keep an up-to-date schedule of my upcoming talks up on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/ecampidoglio">Lanyrd</a>.

  <h2>Podcasts</h2>
  <p>
    Here's a list of podcasts I have been a guest on:
  </p>

  <h4>.NET Rocks! 1079: <a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1079" target="_blank">Databases in Continuous Delivery</a></h4>
  <p>While I was at NDC London 2014, I spoke to Carl and Richard about including
  relational databases in the Continuous Delivery process. I had a lot of fun
  doing this episode and we even managed to squeeze in a few words about vintage
  computers â€” I couldn't have asked for more.</p>

  <h4>.NET Rocks! 1082: <a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1082" target="_blank">State of DevOps in .NET at NDC London</a></h4>
  <p>This episode was a panel discussion recorded live in front of an audience at NDC London
  2014. The topic was the presence of the DevOps culture among .NET developers.
  During the discussion we also shared our experiences with implementing Continuous Delivery in .NET projects. The panel consisted of Ben Hall, Peter Mounce, Jeff French and myself.</p>

  <h2>Presentations</h2>
  <p>Here's a selection of some of the most popular presentations that I've been
  giving during the past few years. In each of them you'll find the
  <em>slides</em> and <em>demo material</em>. If they've ever been recorded, I'll put up a link to the <em>video</em> as well.
