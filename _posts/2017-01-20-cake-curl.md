For the past year I've been writing all of my build scripts using Cake and I love it. Not so much for the fact that it allows me use C# to define my build process, but rather for the way it integrates to many of the command-line tools that I need to compile, test, package and deploy my .NET apps.

Here, let me show you:

```csharp
#tool XUnit2

Task("Compile")
    .Does(() =>
{
    DotNetBuild("src/Solution.sln");
});

Task("Test")
    .DependsOn("Compile")
    .Does(() =>
{
    XUnit2("src/Tests/Tests.csproj");
});
```

See how instead of concatenating a string to invoke `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4\msbuild.exe` with the right set of arguments, I can simply say:

```csharp
DotNetBuild("src/Solution.sln");
```

To run the tests, I don't have to care about bundling the xUnit executable.
