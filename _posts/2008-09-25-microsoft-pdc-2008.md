##  Microsoft PDC 2008!

### 25/09/2008

October 27 – 30 I will be attending [Microsoft Professional Developer Conference 2008][1] in Los Angeles, USA.

PDC is considered one of the most important events in the IT industry as it is usually the place where Microsoft makes its big announcements. Because its nature, the conference is now held every year, but only in the face of a big new technology wave.

Last PDC was held in 2005 where Microsoft announced and previewed the next version of Windows codename “Longhorn” (originally meant to be Vista’s codename, but that later lead to the development of Windows Server 2008).
Before that, on PDC 2000 the world was introduced to a new development platform called the .NET Framework, a new web programming model called ASP%2B (later to be known as ASP.NET) and got a sneak-peak of the next Windows code-named “Whistler”, which later became Windows XP.![PDC_2008_logo][2]

This year PDC focuses around the **Software %2B Services** model. This is a new style of building applications that consume data stored on the Internet, where it is exposed through a series of services. These application leverage the ubiquity of the Internet to give users access to their data, whether it might be work documents or family pictures, from anywhere. Of course this is a  **big shift** from the model we have been used to for the last 20 years, where applications store data locally on the computer.

Another big topic is of course, as it is tradition, the next release of Windows, this time simply code-named “Windows 7″. Rumors say it will be a “[minor upgrade][3]” to Windows Vista, but a the same time Microsoft is talking about big innovations like support for [multi-touch-computing][4]. Mixed signals then, we will just have to wait a little longer to find out what it really is all about.

I will be posting my impressions and whatever interesting piece of information I can get during the conference.
