Whenever my interest for mechanical keyboards comes up in conversation, the question of how many keyboards I have follows up naturally. The answer, however, often comes as a surprise: "maybe only six or seven". At that point, the conversation usually moves on to a different subject so I never get a chance to talk about _which_ keyboards I have, which seems to me like the more interesting question.

Look, I understand that not many people are interested in computer keyboards[^1] — much less mechanical ones — and that's OK. However, I figured that if nobody will listen to me talk about my collection of mechanical keyboards, at least I can always _write_ about them.

So, here is a list of the keyboards that I have as of 2016, together with some interesting facts about each of them. Oh and by the way, the list is in chronologial order starting from the oldest one.
