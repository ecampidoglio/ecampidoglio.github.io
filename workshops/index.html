  <p>I put together a number of workshops that I can deliver for you and your team on request. They come with a specific set of contents, but I can always customize the agenda to meet your specific needs, if you so desire.</p>

  <p>All workshops include a Q&A session. In order to get the most out of it, I encourage you to email me your questions beforehand. That will help me get a sense for where you stand on the topic and identify any particular areas where to put extra emphasis during the workshop.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to know more, here's how you can <a href="/offering/#contact">contact me</a>.</p>

    <span class="nowrap">Understanding Git —</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">Behind the Command Line</span><br/>
    <span class="subtitle">1 Day — Beginner</span>
  </h2>

  <p>Git has become the <em>de-facto</em> version control system of our industry, and for good reason. What you're able to achieve with Git is unmatched by any other version control system that came before it. But for all its power and flexibility, Git has a terrible flaw: its complexity. A myriad of awkwardly named commands and options, have earned Git the reputation of being <em>hard</em>—and unnecessarily so—both to learn and to use.</p>

  <p>You won't find me arguing with that. In fact, I, too, question whether we need that many options and, most of all, I have my reservations about some of the name choices.</p>

  <p>However, I don't believe that Git is hard to <em>understand</em>. In fact, it's quite the opposite — Git is surprisingly simple at its core. If you don't believe me, open up Git's manual page by typing <code>man git</code> in your favorite command-line shell. If you take a look at the very first paragraph, you'll see this:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>git — the stupid content tracker</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>It says it right in the tagline. Git is nothing more than a simple, yet very efficient, <em>content tracker for your files</em>. The key to unlock its power and flexibility is to understand it at a fundamental level. And I found that the best way to do so is by actually seeing what's going on <em>behind</em> all those cryptic commands and options.</p>

  <p>That's exactly what this workshop is about.</p>

  <h3>What You Will Learn</h3>

  <p>In this workshop, you'll learn Git from the inside out; you will understand how the different commands work by watching a <em>real-time visual representation</em> of Git's internal object model.</p>

  <p>Each time you run a common operation like <em>creating a branch</em>, <em>merging</em> or <em>rebasing</em>, you'll immediately see how it affects the underlying history of your repository. This will give you a useful mental model of how Git works. Once you have that, all of the magic will disappear and you'll finally be able to make Git work for you instead of the other way around.</p>

  <h3>Topics</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The Git Parable</li>
    <li>Git's object model</li>
    <li>Anatomy of a commit</li>
    <li>Customizing the way you view history</li>
    <li>What the <em>index</em> is and what it's good for</li>
    <li>Branching, a visual explanation</li>
    <li>Rebasing, a visual explanation</li>
    <li>Different kinds of branches</li>
    <li>Different ways of merging</li>
    <li>Branches vs. Tags</li>
    <li>Resolving conflicts</li>
    <li>Choosing a Git client that works for you</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Audience</h3>

  <p>This workshop is designed for developers who have little to no experience with Git. The only prerequisite is that you're somewhat familiar with using a command-line shell for your operating system of choice. During the workshop, I'll show you how to interact with Git from either <em>PowerShell</em> or <em>Bash</em>.</p>

  <p>Note that you don't have to keep using the command-line after the workshop if you don't want to; we'll use it as a <em>learning tool</em> to understand how Git works. Once you master the concepts, you'll be able to choose any Git client of your liking and make the most out of it.</p>

    <span class="nowrap">Mastering Git —</span>&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">Beyond the Command Line</span><br/>
    <span class="subtitle">1 Day — Intermediate</span>
  </h2>

  <p>You've been using Git for a while and feel pretty comfortable with the basics: committing, creating branches, merging — you got that. However, something is missing; maybe you feel you're not taking full advantage of what Git has to offer; maybe you occasionally end up with an entangled history and would like to know how to avoid that. You want to know more. If this sounds like your situation, then this workshop is for you.</p>

  <p>Mastering Git is about going <em>beyond</em> the basics and learn to truly unleash the power of Git to support your working style, both individually as well as within your team.</p>

  <p>You will discover that Git is so much more than simply branching and merging; its unique features are designed to allow you to take care of your project's history while, at the same time, enabling new forms of collaboration. And that's not all: along the way you'll pick up a few tricks that will directly improve your personal day-to-day workflow.</p>

  <h3>What You Will Learn</h3>

  <p>The goal of this workshop is to teach you to take advantage of the unique features that set Git apart from the other version control systems.</p>

  <p> You'll start out by learning the value of keeping a <em>clean history</em> and how Git was designed to let you do just that. You'll become aware of what makes a <em>good commit</em> and how you can apply those principles to your project. We'll also discuss the pros and cons of rewriting commits and the eternal debate of <em>readable history</em> vs. <em>true history</em>.</p>

  <p>Next, you'll learn about the different branching strategies (like <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model" target="_blank">GitFlow</a> and <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow" target="_blank">GitHub Flow</a>), their advantages and disadvantages and when it makes sense to use one or the other in a given project. You will also learn how to use <em>submodules</em> to manage the dependencies between different projects.</p>
  
  <p>Along the way, you will also pick up a few techniques that will make your personal workflow more efficient; among other things, you'll learn how to use the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog" target="_blank"><em>reflog</em></a> to recover seemingly lost commits, how to work on different tasks in parallel by keeping <em>multiple working directories</em> and how to quickly find the commit that introduced a bug by doing a <em>binary search</em>.</p>

  <h3>Topics</h3>

  <ul>
      <li>The importance of keeping a <a href="/2014/08/14/the-importance-of-a-good-looking-history">good-looking history</a></li>
    <li>ACID commits</li>
    <li>Ensuring consistent line-endings and whitespace</li>
    <li>When and how to rewrite history</li>
    <li>The many ways to use <code>git-rebase</code></li>
    <li>Choosing a branching strategy for your project</li>
    <li>GitFlow vs. GitHub Flow vs. Your Own Flow™</li>
    <li>Managing dependencies between projects with <em>submodules</em></li>
    <li>Searching history</li>
    <li>Recovering lost commits</li>
    <li>Reusing conflict resolutions (<code>git-rerere</code>)</li>
    <li>Managing multiple working directories (<code>git-worktree</code>)</li>
    <li>Debugging (<code>git-bisect</code>)</li>
    <li>Taking care of your repository (<code>git-gc</code>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Audience</h3>

  <p>To get the most out of <a href="/workshops/#mastering_git">Mastering Git</a>, you should feel confident with Git's fundamental concepts. If you'd like to strengthen your knowledge in that area, I highly recommend that you take <a href="/workshops/#understanding_git">Understanding Git</a> first and have this as a continuation; both workshops complement each other nicely, since they share the same visualization techniques to explain the concepts.</p>

  <p>You should also be familiar with handling a command-line shell. During the workshop, I'll use either <em>PowerShell</em> or <em>Bash</em>, based on your preference.</p>
